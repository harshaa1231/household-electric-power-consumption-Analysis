This is a Project that was developed for an analysis on the electricity consumption that every household applicances uses the dataset was self made.
The ML model that had been used to achieve the targeted goal was LSTM (Long short-term memory) it is a Recurrent Neural Network model. 
Specific reason for using this model is because of our dataset was vast and LSTM can better retain long-term dependencies in the data.
